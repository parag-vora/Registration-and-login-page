# C++ Based Login System

This is a basic console-based login system written in C++.
It allows users to:
- Sign up with a username, email, and password
- Log in using their credentials
- Retrieve a forgotten password by providing their username and email

User data is stored in a simple text file `(logindata.txt)` in the following format:  
`username*email*password`
